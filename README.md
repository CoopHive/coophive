# CoopHive

CoopHive is a two-sided marketplace for computational resources. It enables users to run computational workloads in a permissionless protocol, where anyone can get paid to connect
their compute nodes to the network and run jobs.

It uses an EVM-compatible blockchain to manage agreed job state and payment and use [bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) to manage the compute nodes.
